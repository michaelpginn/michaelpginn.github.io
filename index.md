I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu), supervised by [Dr. Alexis Palmer](https://alexispalmer.github.io) and [Dr. Mans Hulden](https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mahu0110/). I study **computational linguistics** and **natural language processing**, and I am particularly interested in **low-resource and endangered languages**, **generalizability**, and the **relationships between linguistics and language technology**. 

I've worked in software development as a lead developer at [Magnify Your Voice](https://magnifyyourvoice.com), a two-time localization engineering intern at Apple, and as an independent iOS and macOS developer. Right now, I'm working with [xMentium](https://xmentium.com) exploring large language models in the legal domain.

I work with a wide variety of languages, with a particular focus on expanding NLP to languages that are often overlooked. I have 8+ years of Latin experience and am currently learning American Sign Language. My work has involved several indigineous American languages, such as Uspanteko and Arapaho.
