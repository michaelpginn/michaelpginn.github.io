I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu), supervised by [Prof. Alexis Palmer](https://alexispalmer.github.io) and [Prof. Mans Hulden](https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mahu0110/), where I study **computational linguistics** and **natural language processing**. My research involves low-resource and endangered languages, generalizability and robustness, and the relationships between linguistics and language technology. In particular, I am interested in exploring the ways modern NLP techniques such as large language models (LLMs) can best aid underresourced languages. I obtained my bachelor's in Computer Science, with a second major in Linguistics, from Washington University in St. Louis in 2022.

I've worked in **software development** as a four-time intern at Apple working on localization software engineering, machine learning, and large language models. I'm currently a student researcher at [xMentium](https://xmentium.com) where I am exploring large language models and domain adaptation for legal texts. I've built several apps as a an independent [iOS and macOS developer](https://apps.apple.com/lt/developer/michael-ginn/id1416885467) and working as a student software engineer at [Magnify Your Voice](https://magnifyyourvoice.com). 

I study a wide variety of languages, with a particular focus on expanding NLP to languages that are often overlooked. I have 8+ years of Latin experience and am currently learning American Sign Language. My work has involved several indigineous American languages, such as Uspanteko and Arapaho.
