I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu), supervised by [Dr. Alexis Palmer](https://alexispalmer.github.io) and [Dr. Mans Hulden](https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mahu0110/). I study **computational linguistics** and **natural language processing**, and I am particularly interested in **low-resource and endangered languages**, **generalizability**, and the **relationships between linguistics and language technology**.
