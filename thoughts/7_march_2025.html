                I suspect that studying a language is a bit like studying a
                snowflake. Even at a distance, you can see the structure and
                intentionality, and as you get closer and pull out a magnifying
                glass you can see more tiny, beautiful details. These details
                almost seem to go infinitely smaller—a fractal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as the expert, you can fill a book with your knowledge
                about the snowflake. Turns out, others have written their own
                books on
                their own snowflakes, and browsing through them you can find
                patterns that look the same as yours. You might even devote your
                life to reading these books and sorting the snowflakes into
                piles based on their patterns, so you can now understand
                (roughly) all of the snowflakes in the world. However, it's a
                bit uncertain whether you've really learned much about
                snowflakes at all!
            </p>
            <p>
                This is unashamedly a bit of a rant about the current research
                agenda of (formal) linguistics. The vast majority of
                garden-variety generative grammar work is endlessly looking
                closer at snowflakes, hoping that maybe if we look close enough
                we will suddenly see what snowflakes are. Meanwhile, typology is
                going around recording data on various snowflakes and making up
                categorizations, in hopes that maybe a big enough sample will
                reveal the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason we understand what snowflakes are is because we
                understand how they are formed. It seems to me like that must be
                how we should understand language. We would need to understand
                how it is produced and processed in the brain, how it arises
                within a population, how it spreads and changes, what laws of
                information theory govern it, and how variation occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not to stretch the metaphor too far, but I do suspect it is the
                case that language has a fractal attractor. That is, the
                formation of a language instance is so highly sensitive to some
                random starting condition (whatever that means in the context of
                a population) that it is impossible to predict the full extent
                of its rules (which have infinite complexity, limited only by
                hardware restrictions).
            </p>

                    biological motivation.
