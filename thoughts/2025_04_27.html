                27 april 2025 - regarding cheating in the age of AI
            </h3>
            <p>
                There's ongoing debate within cs pedagogy about the correct
                response to AI-based assignment completion, which would
                traditionally be considered "plagiarism."
            </p>
            <p>
                On one hand, a majority (perhaps) of students are now producing
                all of their code via an LLM app, which would certainly fall
                under the restrictions on the use of external resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, LLMs are here to stay, and only getting harder to
                detect through any objective measure.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i
                    >(My school uses "interview grading", where we ask students
                    random questions about their code in hopes of catching a
                    cheater. This has roughly a 0% success rate.)</i
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                My take is that we already have an analogous pedagogical model:
                mathematics education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Math ed, like CS ed, largely relies on 1) graded exercises and
                2) synchronous examination. Currently, a key difference is that
                CS heavily upweights the graded exercises (i.e. "homework").
                Meanwhile, mathematics upweights examinations, because for the
                highest level of math that most students will ever take, there
                are online tools that can perfectly solve any problem you can
                assign.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think CS ed is now in a similar spot thanks to ChatGPT. Chat
                (as affectionately it is known) can whiz through any CS
                assignment for like 90% of classes. After all, that's
                essentially the
                <i>main thing it was trained to do (w.r.t. coding).</i> Think
                about the format of a coding instruct prompt--"Write a function
                that..."--that is essentially the same as a homework prompt.
                <b
                    >LLMs are not just good at homework, they are quite
                    literally trained to be homework machines.</b
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, the obvious solution is to reweight how we do grading,
                and massively upweight exams, and make it clear to students that
                they don't have to work hard on their homeworks, but it will
                cost them come exam.
