## Building Endangered Language Technology (BELT)
[BELT](https://belt.rc.colorado.edu) is a highly-interactive course for creating low-resource language technology with no prior programming experience. The goal of BELT is to make it easy to build and deploy usable, real-world tools for speakers within endangered language communities. BELT is available as an online platform and occasionally an in-person workshop, the last of which was June 2023 in Bogota, Colombia.

## Interlinear Gloss Generation
Interlinear glossed text is a common format used by linguists for language documentation, and it can be used to accelerate the development of low-resource NLP approaches. Since the creation of IGT is time-consuming and painstaking, there is great benefit to partially automating the process. I've researched various neural approaches to automating IGT creation, exploring techniques such as transfer learning, custom loss functions, and semi-supervised training.
